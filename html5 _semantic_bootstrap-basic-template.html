    <!-- Steps and don't forget to...
  1. Gather Content Requirements.
  2. Separate content into 'Primary' content and 'Secondary' content.
  3. Outline content into 'Structure' of page (get approval of outline?).
  4. In text editor, create starting html opener, head area with links to generic css and js folders.
  5. In text editor, write comments that outline basic structure of content before starting to code.
  6.  In text editor, create document sections by using html5 semantics tags.

  Useage in general but see style guidelines for specifics:
  Main = identifies 'main' content and purpuse of a page
  Header = use for introduction of content or for navigation
  Article = a piece of clothing (independent of page)
  Section = group semantic content together
  Aside = is related to but not directly connected
  Div = for decorative or non-semantic content
  Footer = information about section such as author, links,             copyright, disclaimers, etc
  Figure and figcaption = use for illustrations, diagram, images that   fit content needs (not for decorative elements)
  Description List <dl> and <dd> = associated lists to content
  id vs. class (used semantically) = id for unique identification of   sections within page; class for repeatative elements or <non->     </non->unique identification
  (Have consistent useage within project of how tags are used.)

  7. Add Bootstrap classes to semantic tags as needed.

  Basic Bootstrap 'getting started' classes to add to semantic tags:
      *** First you must have this for 'mobile first'--<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> in your <head> section
  .container (fixed width container)
  .container-fluid (full width container)
  .row (creates 12 grid framework)
  .col-*-* (* = the desired number of columns to span. Note that numbers in .col-*-* within a row should always add up to 12 for each row)

  8. Tip: as you create semantic tags, ids, and classes and/or if you are going to overwrite Bootstrap css classes, then add these elements to your CSS file as you work on your html file. It will save you time and help you stay organized.
  9. Remember to use 'alt' and 'title' on images and 'alt' on links.
  10. Remember to use 'role' on elements that need it's role descripted for accessiblity.
